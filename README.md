### The problem of unmeasured variables in animal social network analysis: can edge-based multilevel models provide a reliable solution?

*Tyler R. Bonnell, Chloe Vilette*


**Main take-aways:**

If there are unmeasured variables that provide constraints/opportunities for individuals to interact…

•	Non-temporal methods can only identify patterns, not mechanisms. I.e., If we find reciprocity/transitivity in the network it does not mean that individual behaviour is impacted/driven by reciprocity/transitivity.

•	If we are asking about how social structures impact behaviour, then we should take a dynamic approach to SNA and use edge-based models with additive and multiplicative random effects structure, otherwise we’re likely to get misleading results.


**Abstract:**

Recent approaches to analysing social networks suggest that modeling the edges of the network and using multilevel models will produce more informative estimates. These recent methods have been proposed as a way to better handle the dependency structures of social networks, account for biases in data collection, and retain uncertainty when making inferences about social network structures. We show that they have the potential to also effectively handle unmeasured variables that act as statistical confounds. Using simulated data, we show that taking a dynamic approach and using additive and multiplicative random effects provides more reliable results when a statistical confound is present. Additive and multiplicative random effects also generates better posterior networks for post model tasks, and provides information about social structures not captured by the predictors, facilitating exploratory analysis. We show that a keep-it-maximal approach for random effects is beneficial for edge-based multilevel models of social networks, and that such approaches can be effective when there are potentially unmeasured variables that are not captured by model predictors.
